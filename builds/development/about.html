            <p>My name is Matt Ray. I am 24 years old living in Colorado right now. This is my personal website that I will try to keep updated as much as possible. I have been trying to learn everything I can about web design because I find it to be very interesting, and I would like to make a career out of it. I spend the majority of my free time on a computer, and learning about the internet and how it works is an invaluable skill that I think more people should have. I have only been doing this for about a year and a half so I still have a long way to go but I will continue to progress as much as I can. </p>

            <p>I have developed an interest in computers after building one for myself a few years ago. I like messing around with hardware. I don’t have a lot of money so my computer is not as high tech as I would like it to be, but part of the fun is slowly upgrading over time. I have built a few other PCs for some other people as well. I sometimes do computer repair and virus removals for friends and family.  It is not the most interesting thing in the world so I don’t want to do it full time, but can be a very useful thing to learn. I also have studied and researched quite a lot about Bitcoin. I believe that digital currency is step toward the future of money. Bitcoin is an extremely interesting technology and experiment. It provides a unique solution to a lot of financial problems in the world today. Even if Bitcoin is not adopted into the mainstream and eventually dies out, I am happy to support it for now based on the ideas that it bring to the table. In one way or another the technology behind Bitcoin will be truly revolutionary moving into the future.</p>

            <p>Aside from computer stuff, one of my favorite hobbies is rock climbing. I have been climbing since I was about 10 years old. Living in Colorado has given me the opportunity to climb outside all the time and also train in some of the best gyms in the country. I used to go to competitions quite a bit when I was younger, but now I just do it mostly for fun. I have made a lot of great friends through climbing, and the community is very close knit and supportive. The thing that fascinates me the most about climbing is the unique movement. It can be very intuitive and natural, and very foreign and awkward at the same time. There is such a wide variety of movement that no two problems or routes feel the same. Also things can be climbed quite differently depending on a persons size or style which adds even more depth to it. It is fun to approach it like a problem, and find a correct solution that fits for myself. I have gotten pretty good at only needing a handful of tries to complete a problem because I think about every move in advance before trying it.</p>
