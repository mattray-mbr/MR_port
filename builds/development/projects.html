       <h3>A bit about my workflow and design process</h3>
       <p class="words">Right now I am focusing more on responsive design rather than advacnced functionality with my work. I am primarily using bootstrap and sass in most of my projects to achieve flexiblity and effecientcy. I also use jquery for most of the scripts. I am looking into other scripting libraries like coffee-script, typescript, ember.js. I want to gradually bring in more functionality into my projects while keeping responsive design at the core of everything. </p>
       <h3>Rayce Gravity</h3>
       <p class="words"> Rayce Gravity is one of the first sites I have done. I have re-done the site several times, hopefully improving it each time as I learn more. Due to not having a ton of information about the business I decided to go with a simple single-page layout this time around. It is supposed to look good on all screen sizes and devices.</p>

       <h3> Blaze Gaming</h3>
       <p class="words">Blaze Gaming is a template for a online gaming guild and community. Although not entirely in use, I am working on making it fully funtional in all aspects. I decided to go with a gaming site because it gives me something that I am directly in control over rather than a website for some other business. With there being a ton of other guild sites via platforms like guild launch, I can draw inspiration from what they do, while understanding just how to impliment certain features by myself. It is an ongoing project that even if it is never used by other people is a good next step for adding functionality and a testing ground for me to learn without impeding on anyone else. </p>
       <h3>Camelot Unchained UI addon</h3>
       <p class="words">Camelot Unchained is a new MMORPG that is coming out in late 2016. They have designed their user interface for the game around a web-based platform that utilizes html javascript and typescript, making it very easy for the modding community to customize the game UI to their personal preference. I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to work on a project that is a bit different from a website while still falling under the category of web design. Currently I am waiting for the game to develope a little more and the ui-api to become fullly available to see what I can do as far as mod creation and what is needed in the game to make it more functional.</p>
       <p class="future-update"> I have a bunch of other ideas for projects planned in the future, I'm just not ready to share what those are and won't post them until they are further along in development. Stay tuned for other things coming. </p>
