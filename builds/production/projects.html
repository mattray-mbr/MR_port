I am primarily using bootstrap, sass, and compass in most of my projects to achieve flexiblity and effecientcy. I use jquery for most of the scripts although I am looking into other scripting libraries like coffee-script, typescript, underscore, ember.js. I want to gradually bring in more functionality into my projects which means each project should be slightly more advanced than the last. I am learning to use gulp and node npm for installing packages and to better manage my workflow as well as git for a cms.</p><h3> This site</h3> <p class="words">Just a simple portfolio website that I will be using from now on. It's kind of still in a rough draft phase, but I will be updating it gradually over the next year or so until I get everything fullly fleshed out the way I want it. I went with a very natural earthy color scheme which reflects who I am and where I grew up. I still need to test and update the contact form as it is not fully functional right now. Overall I am pretty satisfied with how the site looks at this point in time.</p><h3>Rayce Gravity</h3> <p class="words"> Rayce Gravity is one of the first sites that I have done. I have re-done the site several times, hopefully improving it each time as I learn more. It was made for a family member that has a small start-up business. Due to not having a ton of information about the business I decided to go with a simple single-page layout this time around. As it is a bootstrap framework, the layout changes a bit from wide-screen to mobile. Overall load time is a bit slow because of the pictures so I will try to improve this in the future.</p><div class="work-imgs"> <a href="http://www.raycegravity.com" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/RayceMultiple.png" alt="RayceGravPics"></a> </div><h3> Blaze Gaming</h3> <div class="work-imgs"> <a href="http://www.blazegaming.com" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive blazepic" src="images/placeholder.png" alt="blazegaming"></a> </div><p class="words">My current and unfinished project. Blaze Gaming is a template for a online gaming guild and community. Although not intended to be in use, I am working on making it fully funtional in all aspects. I decided to go with a gaming site for a few reasons. It allows me to build it the way that I want instead of apealing to a bussiness or other group. Also with there being a ton of other guild sites via platforms like guild launch, I can draw inspiration from what they do, while understanding just how to impliment certain features by myself. I can also work on different features over time as I learn the ins and outs of things like forums, secure log-in, api's, and other things. It will be an ongoing project that even if never used by other people is a good step for me in adding functionality. It is more of a testing ground than anything else for me to learn without impeding on anyone or being restricted to a deadline.</p><p class="future-update"> I have a bunch of other ideas for projects planned in the future, I'm just not ready to share what those are and won't post them until they are further along in development. Stay tuned for other things coming. </p></div></div><footer> <span class="footerleft">created by Matthew Ray</span> <span class="footerright">last updated July 2015</span> </footer> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/script.js"></script></body></html>
